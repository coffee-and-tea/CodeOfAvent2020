# CodeOfAvent2020
Practice for https://adventofcode.com/2020/

Fun fact:
Repository name CodeOfAvent2020 is not a typo: I started my journey of first advent of code on year of 2020, also raising my first new born boy using lots of `Avent` brand things. More of a daddy joke here.

Day01:
2 sum and 3 sum questions, with 2 solutions:
- solution one: first sort the input then binary search for result, with 2 sum complexity is O(n*logn), 3 sum is O(n^2*logn)
- solution two use exact space without sorting: with 2 sum complexity is O(n), 3 sum is (n^2)

Day2:
String data validation, using stream function first question complexity of O(n), second question complexity of O(1)
